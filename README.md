# Structure-from-Motion-and-Point-Clouds-3D-Reconstruction-and-Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on utilizing computer vision techniques to perform Structure from Motion (SfM) and Point Cloud analysis. The goal is to create a 3D model of objects or scenes from 2D images and apply data analysis algorithms for further insights.

Technologies Used
OpenCV: Used for image processing, feature extraction, and SfM algorithms.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations, matrix manipulations, and data handling.
SciPy: Employed for scientific computing tasks such as optimization and clustering algorithms.
Features
Structure from Motion (SfM): Implemented SfM techniques to reconstruct 3D scenes from a sequence of 2D images. Utilized feature matching, camera calibration, and bundle adjustment for accurate 3D reconstruction.

Point Cloud Generation: Created point clouds from the reconstructed 3D scenes. Used depth information and camera parameters to map 2D points to 3D coordinates, forming a dense point cloud representation.

K-means Clustering: Applied K-means clustering algorithm to segment the point cloud data into clusters based on spatial similarity. This analysis aids in identifying distinct regions or objects within the 3D model.

Point Cloud Downsampling: Implemented point cloud downsampling algorithms to reduce the data size while preserving important features. This step is crucial for efficient storage and processing of large-scale point cloud data.
